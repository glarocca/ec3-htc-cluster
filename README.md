# EC3-htc-cluster

This document describes how to use the Elastic Cloud Computing Cluster (EC3) platform to create elastic virtual clusters on the EGI Cloud.

## Requirements

* Basic knowledge of Linux user environment and [Docker container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container/) are requested
* A working environment with the [EC3 Docker CLI](https://github.com/grycap/ec3#ec3-in-docker-hub) installed 
* A valid access token to access the [EGI Cloud infrastructure](https://egi-federated-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/federation.html)

## Install the EC3 CLI

EC3 has an official Docker container image available in Docker Hub that can be used instead of installing the CLI. 
You can download it with:

<pre>
]$ sudo docker pull grycap/ec3
</pre>

The CLI will allow you to exploit all the potential of EC3 from your computer.

</pre>

## Listing available EC3 clusters

To list the available running clusters, use the command:

<pre>
]$ sudo docker run -v /var/.ec3/clusters:/root/.ec3/clusters grycap/ec3 list

      name          state           IP        nodes 
----------------------------------------------------
 haddock-cluster  configured  XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX    0   
     cluster      configured  XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX   0   
</pre>

## Authorization file

The authorization file stores in plain text the credentials to access the cloud providers, the IM service and the VMRC service. Each line of the file is composed by pairs of key and value separated by semicolon, and refers to a single credential. The key and value should be separated by `=`, that is an equal sign preceded and followed by one white space at least.

Example of cloud provider with OIDC-based authentication:

<pre>
]$ cat auth.dat
id = PROVIDER_ID; type = OpenStack; host = KEYSTONE_ENDPOINT; username = egi.eu; tenant = openid; domain = DOMAIN_NAME; auth_version = 3.x_oidc_access_token; password = OIDC_ACCESS_TOKEN
</pre>

Where:
* `id` is the id of the cloud provider (e.g.: cesgatoegi)
* `host` is the public IP address of the cloud provider Keystone service (e.g.: https://fedcloud-osservices.egi.cesga.es:5000/v3)
* `domain` is the project tenant in the cloud provider (e.g.: enmr.eu)
* `password` is the access token

## Get an Access Token
Login the EGI AAI Check-In [EGI AAI Check-In](https://aai.egi.eu/fedcloud) service. Copy and paste in your terminal the CURL command to generate a valid access token valid for 1h. 

## Template used to configure the EC3 cluster

The cluster will be configured with the following templates:
* torque (default)
* [centos7-OIDC-IN2P3-IRES_Torque (custom)](ec3/templates/centos7-OIDC-IN2P3-IRES_Torque.radl)
* [configure_cluster (custom)](ec3/templates/configure_cluster.radl)
* [configure_nfs (custom)](ec3/templates/configure_nfs.radl)
* [refreshtoken (default)](ec3/templates/refreshtoken.radl)

User's templates are stored in: `$HOME/ec3/templates`

## Create an elastic EC3 cluster

To launch a cluster, you can use the recipes that you have locally by mounting the folder as a volume, or create your dedicated ones. Also, it is recommendable to maintain the data of active clusters locally, by mounting a volume. In the next example, we are going to deploy a new Torque/Maui cluster in one cloud provider of the EGI Federation. CentOS7 as base OS will be used to configure the front-node and the workers of the EC3 elastic cluster.

<pre>
]$ docker run -v /home/centos/:/tmp/ \
                 -v /home/centos/ec3/templates:/root/.ec3/templates \
                 -v /var/.ec3/clusters:/root/.ec3/clusters grycap/ec3 launch cluster_name \
                 torque centos7-OIDC-IN2P3-IRES_Torque cluster_configure refreshtoken configure_nfs \
                 -a /tmp/auth.dat
